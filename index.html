        title: 'First',
        content: `Finally the day has come when I want to tell you something, 
It's for you and else for nothing. 
My heart sank that day, 
Still remember those sleepless nights, thinking of you which one could never pay. 
Listening ill about you was unbearable for me to stay quiet, 
But my heart didn't let me do that. 
Can't forget that confession thing,when you cried and cried and cried, 
Hearing that from you, I felt like stabbing those glassy-eyed. 
I felt shy talking to you, 
But collected some courage to talk to you. , 
Hearing your voice the first time, 
Made me like a star that shines. 
Talking to you became a necessity, 
I preferred to talk to you with all .....ty. 
Don't know why I cried in your pain, 
It was like beating up with a cane. 
Everyone teased me by your name, 
I was to give them a box on their frame. 
I loved you from my whole heart, 
You just hit my heart with a dart!! 
I promise I would never betray you
I want you to sue me if I did it to you
I don't have the flair of writing poems, 
But to tell you about my feelings I compose!!!`
      },
      poem2: {
        title: 'Special One',
        content: `You are special in every way,‚ù§Ô∏è
Supporting me more and more and more each passing day.
You are the reason I'm so strong üí™
With you at the helm not a thing could go wrong.‚úÖ
You've helped me through many trials, 
You've made things better in every situation.üëÜ
Thank you for always being there,üëè
And showing me that you truly care. 
Words could never explain how I feel about you,
But I hope you know that I truly appreciate you!‚ù§Ô∏è`
      },
      poem3: {
        title: 'Heartbreaküíî',
        content: `Lost in time, a year has passed,
Yet memories linger, a love that was vast.
The pain's still fresh, like needles in my heart,
Living without you, a soul torn apart.

Never did I fathom a life without your touch,
Every second a struggle, hope's lost as such.
No love compared to the one I had for you,
Overwhelming, consuming, a love so true.

Each day, thoughts of you refuse to cease,
Sleep eludes me, memories bring no peace.
Happy for what was, yet weep for what's gone,
Yearning for eternity, a love that shone.

No other can capture my heart in that way,
A depth of emotion, words fail to convey.
I was not myself, merged with your soul,
Now left in fragments, an incomplete whole.

I'm tangled within, a mess deep within me,
Smiling outside, while inside I can't be free.
Building walls to guard, to prevent the pain,
But lost in confusion, not knowing what remains.

Help me unravel this maze in my mind,
To heal the wounds, a solace to find.`
      },
      poem4: {
        title: 'Kü™ê',
        content: `In June's embrace, a match did bloom,
On Bumble's screen, in a sunny room,
A girl, I thought, perhaps quite dumb,
Yet, in our talks, two souls did resonate.

We shared our pain, our broken lives,
As if fate's mirrored, our souls in ties,
Talking to you, I felt alive,
A connection rare, no disguise.

Then came a break, a fleeting end,
But destiny, it chose to mend,
As college gates, they did extend,
Our bond reborn, like an angel, a friend.

Through trials and tears, I found my way,
Guided by words, I'd often say,
Though some may call you brainless, they,
Fail to see the light, our bonds light the way.

My pain, my sadness, did decrease,
With every word, I found some peace,
Though I'm but a virtual release,
You were there to help, to bring surcease.

So here's a short and heartfelt note,
A thank you gift, for time I wrote,
Forever in debt, I'll devote,
For the hope and strength, I helped promote.

Keep on smiling, never change,
In life's vast sea, a constant range,
We'll hope to meet, a promise exchange,
In the future bright, new horizons exchange.`
      },
      poem5: {
        title: '27th December',
        content: `Through challenges and trials, we've found our way,
Meeting at last, brighter than the day.
To Jaipur we journey, our bond so true,
Grateful for moments, just me and you.

A gem in my life, you shine so bright,
At my lowest point, you were my light.
Your stubborn ways, I've come to adore,
It's part of you, couldn't ask for more.

You're vital to me, like air, like dew, 
With each passing day, my feelings grew.
I can see you're blushing while reading this don't blush, 
In our journey together, a bond so plush.

For the words I've spoken, in anger and haste, 
I'm truly sorry, let's forget the distaste. 
At my lowest point, you were my guide, 
With you by my side, I never felt denied.


Though storms may come, our bond won't sway, 
In 2023, you made my best days. 
Ending the year, with memories so clear,
Thank you,K, for always being near.`
      },
      poem6: {
        title: '25th January',
        content: `On the twenty-fifth of January, a fleeting share,
Eight hours dancing, time so rare.
From pickup to drop-off, seamless transition, 
Lost in moments, a beautiful rendition.

Those precious hours, a treasure untold, 
A smile ignited in memories, unfold.
Amidst joy, a shield against what's to come, 
Comforting presence, a steady drum.

Biryani shared, gifts exchanged, town explored,
Burgers savored, every memory stored.
In the car's embrace, where time would sway, 
A grateful thank you, for brightening my day.

Happiness sown, facing difficulties with glee, 
Your presence, guiding me. 
With gratitude profound, I extend my view, 
For the gift you gave, and all that it drew. `
      },
      poem7: {
        title: 'Pleadüíî',
        content: `In the depths of life's relentless strife,
I longed for you, my guiding light,
To share my woes, my inner plight,
But you were distant, out of sight.

Frustration, anger, stress did brew,
Within my heart, a storm grew,
I yearned for solace, a friend so true,
But your indifference, it cut me through.

I painted smiles, a facade to wear,
While inside, I crumbled in despair,
Alone I stood, in this world unfair,
Betrayed by those I thought would care.

Yet I'll endure, I'll stand and fight,
Through the darkest days and endless nights,
For in my heart, there burns a light,
To find my peace and make it right.`
      },
      poem8: {
        title: 'Life Lately',
        content: `Life's a heavy burden, on the edge I stand,
With a weary heart and troubled mind, unplanned.
The stress, weight, my brain in the endless plight,
I hide my feelings, shrouded in the night.

Tension brews, like storm clouds overhead,
Negative thoughts, they fill my soul with dread.
I ponder failure, where would I then reside,
Disappointing hopes, I cannot let them slide.

Yearning for time to swiftly pass on by,
This heavy toll, a heavy-hearted sigh.
But deep within, a glimmer of the light,
Through these trials, I'll find my strength to fight.

In life's tough grip, I'll hold on to my dreams,
With faith and hope, I'll mend my broken seams.
Through the darkest hours, I'll learn to heal,
For in this journey, my heart will seal its zeal.`
      },
      poem9: {
        title: 'Dont Give Up',
        content: `In the depths of the ocean, I struggle for air,
Burdened by secrets I cannot bear.
For years, I've carried this weight inside,
Longing to share, but fear has me tied.

I've always been honest, my words plain and true,
Yet darkness surrounds me, a relentless hue.
I question my fate, the reasons unknown,
Why must I suffer while others are shown?

The person I desire to confide in, you see,
Is the very same one who bestowed upon me
These feelings and thoughts that consume my soul,
Leaving me gasping, struggling for control.

I yearn to release the words I've suppressed,
To reveal the pain that's left me distressed.
But how do I find the courage to confess,
When did the source of my anguish caused this mess?

Oh, sleep eludes me, haunted by the night,
Nightmares and memories, an endless fight.
Happiness fades, as thoughts of her persist,
A constant reminder of love I resist.

In this tumultuous life, the path's unclear,
I search for solace, for answers to appear.
Though the wicked may prosper, good deeds undone,
I'll hold onto hope, for a new day to come.

So I'll face my demons, confront my despair,
Find strength in my clarity, my spirit laid bare.
Within these verses, a release I find,
A poem to capture the echoes of my mind.`
      },
      poem10: {
        title: 'ADIEUüíï',
        content: `In the realm of dreams, where fantasies bloom,
I met a soul that chased away the gloom.
In days of old, our friendship grew,
A radiant bond, tried and true.

Each moment shared, a cherished delight,
Bathing in joy, basking in light.
But life, a fickle hand, it dealt its blow,
Turning joy to sorrow, a bitter undertow.

Lemons aplenty, life did bestow,
Shattering dreams, casting shadows low.
Once close, now distant, like a fleeting breeze,
A stranger in guise, a friend's unease.

The closeness shared began to fade,
As distance grew, like a lingering shade.
Once familiar gestures turned estranged,
Leaving me bewildered, feelings rearranged.

Missed are the calls, the video's glow,
Longing for moments, lost in the flow.
My smile, once radiant, now faded and worn,
Leaving me behind, tattered and torn.

Rather than lingering in shadows of gloom,
Let's depart, leaving no room.
In the treasury of friendship, preserved,
The moments of joy, the memories deserved.

In the divine plan, if our destinies align,
No earthly force could sever our twine.
Longing for your presence, in every rhyme,
For you're the one I crave, throughout time.

Farewell, Jupiter, on paths anew,
May happiness follow, in all that you do.
Thank you for the joy, the light you brought,
In my heart, your memory will never be forgot.`
